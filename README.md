# WorkAdventure Space
## What is this?
Workadventure is a spacial audio chat tool that allows people to meet and talk to each other in a pixel world.
This is a map that was built with the help of the Starter Kit from [WorkAdventure](https://workadventu.re).
The goal is to provide an easy to use space for multiple workshops, a lecture room, a space to hang out and enough space for random meetings and conversations.
The zones for the jitsi calls are extra spacious so you don't get accidentally kicked out of the call just because you moved a little bit.
